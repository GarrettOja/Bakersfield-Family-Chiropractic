This was my second project; taught me how to 
work with clients and build a more interactive 
website. With this project I began experimenting 
with Javascript DOM manipulation via my own 
functions and a little bit of jQuery as well. 
This website was also my first project to include 
different layouts for mobile and desktops/tablets 
to create a better looking user interface. If I 
were to do this project over again, I would use 
a lot less custom classes and instead make changes 
to the default Bootstrap classes. I've 
found that this makes it easier to maintain a 
consistant look across the website while keeping 
the classes used to a minimum.
